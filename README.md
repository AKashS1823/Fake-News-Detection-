# Fake-News-Detection-
In this project we train model for the detecting fake news.



**Fake News Detection using Machine Learning**


**Overview**


This is a project to detect fake news using machine learning. The dataset used in this project contains news articles and their labels (real or fake). The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and convert it into numerical vectors. It then trains a logistic regression and a decision tree classifier on the data, and evaluates their accuracy using test data. Finally, the project generates a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project can be found in the news.csv file. It contains over 20,000 news articles with their titles, subjects, dates, text, and labels (1 for real news and 0 for fake news).

**Requirements**

The following libraries are required to run the code:

1.numpy

2.pandas

3.matplotlib

4.seaborn

5.nltk

6.wordcloud

7.sklearn

8.Installation

9.To install the required libraries, run the following command:

**pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud sklearn**

**Usage**

To run the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

**python fake_news_detection.py**


**Results**

The project generates a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. It also calculates the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the models.

**Credits**

This project was created by Akash Singh, with the guidance of CodeClause. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.com.
